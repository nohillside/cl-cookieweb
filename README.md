cl-cookieweb
================

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for Common Lisp projects featuring:

- Canonical Common Lisp project structure, a ready-to-use project with an entry point and unit tests.
- Run project from sources
- Build a binary
- and choose your Lisp implementation
- Test suite using [Fiveam](https://common-lisp.net/project/fiveam/docs/)
  - a [travis](https://travis-ci.org/) CI configuration file (untested)
- [Roswell](https://github.com/roswell/roswell/) recipe (needs tests)
- BSD licenced by default


Usage
-----

Create a new project. You'll be prompted to provide some basic
information about your new project, which will then be auto-generated
in the current working directory:

```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/vindarel/cl-cookieweb
project_name [cookie-lisp-project]:
repo_name [cookie-lisp-project]:
description []: A test project
version [0.0.1]:
year [1984]:
author [CL User]: me
email [me@mail.com]:
username [mme]:
branch [master]:
remote [origin]:
Initialised empty Git repository in /home/vince/bacasable/lisp-projects/cookie-lisp-project/.git/
Switched to a new branch 'master'
```

Run it straight away:

```bash
$ cd cookie-lisp-project
$ make run
rlwrap sbcl --load run.lisp
This is SBCL 2.0.10, an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp.

You can see the `Hello` from the `main` function, and we are given a Lisp REPL.

Build an executable:

```bash
$ make build

## Cookiecutter options

You can use command line options: https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/advanced/cli_options.html

- `--no-input`: do not prompt for parameters and only use cookiecutter.json file content
- ` --replay`: do not prompt for parameters and only use information entered previously
- ` -f, --overwrite-if-exists`: overwrite the contents of the output directory if it already exists
- ` -s, --skip-if-file-exists`: skip the files in the corresponding directories if they already exist
- ` -o, --output-dir`: where to output the generated project dir into
- ` --config-file`: user configuration file

# TODOs

- [ ] more CI setup
- [ ] build a .deb (and .rpm)
- [ ] web project skeleton
